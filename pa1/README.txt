  To run this program use python 3.x and command line arguments localhost <port>, where port is the desired valid port number. 
  Then from another terminal submit git request with telnet and command line arguments localhost <port>, where port is the same valid port number that was provided to the server. The server will keep running until it is given a bad request, so it can be connected to many times without haveing to relaunch it.
